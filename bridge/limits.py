"""
Reads the Claude subscription usage limits from Claude Code's local cache.

Source: ~/.claude.json -> cachedUsageUtilization

This is the same data the /usage panel draws. Claude Code fetches it from the
server and stores it here; we only read. There is no computation of ours — you
cannot derive "43% of the weekly limit" from the transcripts because the
denominator is not public.

Because it is a CACHE, it can be stale. Every read returns `age_s` precisely so
the screen can say "X min ago" instead of pretending the number is live.
