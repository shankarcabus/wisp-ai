"""
Bridge between Claude Code and the mascot on the ESP32-S3.

Takes hook events from Claude Code, derives a state, and serves that state to
the board over HTTP.

Stdlib only — nothing to install.

Endpoints
    POST /hook    <- Claude Code sends its events here
    GET  /state   <- the board fetches state here (lean payload)
    GET  /health  <- liveness
    GET  /debug   <- full state, for a human to inspect

Usage:
    python3 bridge/server.py [port]

        Subscription limits, from the FRESHEST source available.

        Two sources: whatever the app fetched live, and Claude Code's on-disk
        cache. The app can only fetch because it has its own keychain access,
        through the macOS API and with your consent — the bridge never sees the
        credential, which is why it can still run on its own in a terminal.

        THE CRITERION IS AGE, NOT PROVENANCE
        ------------------------------------
        This used to give the live data a 10-minute deadline and fall back to
        the cache past it, no matter how old the cache was. Those two clocks
        never agreed: the app only refetches on the hour when nobody is working
        (see limitsCeiling in Bridge.swift), so for up to 50 minutes of every
        hour the freshest number on the machine was thrown away in favour of
        whatever was on disk.

        And what is on disk can be ANCIENT. Claude Code only rewrites
        cachedUsageUtilization when something makes it fetch; go weeks without
        opening /usage and it does not move. Measured on this machine: the file
        sat 24.7 days old while a 20-minute-old live reading was being
        discarded, and the board proudly displayed "35608 min ago".

        Comparing ages has no such failure mode. If the app stops fetching, the
        cache becomes the fresher of the two on its own and wins without any
        deadline to tune.
