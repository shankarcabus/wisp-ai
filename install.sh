# WHY BUILD INSTEAD OF SHIPPING A .DMG
# ------------------------------------
# An app downloaded from the internet gets macOS's quarantine flag, and without
# a developer signature (US$ 99/year) the system refuses to open it with a
# malware warning. An app built on your own machine never gets that flag.
# Building here is not laziness about packaging — it is what removes the
# friction.
#
# What this script does, in order:
#   1. clones the repository, if you came in through curl
#   2. checks the prerequisites
#   3. builds Wisp.app
#   4. installs it into ~/Applications
#   5. offers to register the Claude Code hooks (with a backup, and your ok)
#   6. offers to flash the board, if one is plugged in
#
# It installs nothing globally, asks for no sudo and touches no system config.
#
#   ./install.sh --no-hooks    do not ask about or register hooks
#   ./install.sh --no-board    ignore any connected board
