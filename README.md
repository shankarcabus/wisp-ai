<p align="center">
  A mascot that shows you what Claude Code is doing.
</p>

In your Mac's menu bar, and optionally on a small AMOLED screen sitting on your
desk.

Every active Claude session becomes a little character with its own state:
working, running a tool, waiting for your permission, asking you a question,
done, failed. When nothing is running the screen turns into a clock and a
weather forecast — a motionless character tells you nothing.

In the menu bar you get usage, subscription limits and your open sessions
without leaving what you were doing.

The panel opens on the board's own two screens, redrawn on the Mac from the
firmware's own measurements — the same composition, the same colours, the same
thresholds. One visual vocabulary for the same information, not two.

## Install

### On the Mac

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marciovicente/wisp-ai/main/install.sh | bash
```

Or, if you would rather read it before running it — and you should:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marciovicente/wisp-ai.git
cd wisp
./install.sh
```

You need macOS 14+ and Apple's command line tools (`xcode-select --install`).
Nothing else: the bridge runs on the Python that already ships with the
system, and the app has no dependencies at all.

The installer builds the app, installs it into `~/Applications`, generates
your token, asks whether it may register the Claude Code hooks — keeping a
copy of your `settings.json` first — and, if a board is plugged into USB,
offers to flash it right there. It never asks for `sudo`, installs nothing
globally and touches no system configuration.

**Why build instead of downloading a finished app:** an app downloaded from
the internet gets macOS's quarantine flag, and without a paid developer
signature the system refuses to open it with a malware warning. An app built
on your own machine never gets that flag. Building here is what *removes* the
friction, not the opposite — and you get to read what you are running.

### On the board (optional)

The app works on its own. The little screen is the extra. With the board
plugged into USB:

```bash
./flash.sh
```

One command: it finds the board, saves Waveshare's factory firmware (which you
cannot get back afterwards — it is not distributed anywhere), flashes Wisp and
asks for your WiFi. The password is typed hidden and goes straight into the
NVS partition along with the bridge token; it never passes through the source
or through git.

**You do not need ESP-IDF.** The binaries come ready from the GitHub release,
and the two flashing tools (`esptool` and the NVS generator) are pulled from
PyPI into a venv under `~/.wisp/tools` the first time — about 15MB, and they
run on the Python 3.9 that macOS itself already ships. If you have a local
build in `firmware/build/`, it uses yours instead of downloading.

Building the firmware does require ESP-IDF 5.5 — but that only matters if you
are going to change it. See [firmware/README.md](firmware/README.md).

```bash
./flash.sh --no-wifi      # firmware only; provision later
./flash.sh --erase        # erase the flash first (board stuck in a boot loop)
```

Hardware: **Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-2.16** (480×480, touch,
accelerometer). Swiping sideways brings up the usage panel; turning the device
rotates the image with it. It only speaks 2.4GHz WiFi.

## What it does on your machine

Transparency matters here, because the app reads your Claude Code data:

| what | where | why |
|---|---|---|
| reads the transcripts | `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` | counting requests and tokens |
| reads the limits cache | `~/.claude.json` | the subscription percentages |
| appends hooks | `~/.claude/settings.json` | knowing what Claude is doing |
| writes configuration | `~/.wisp/config.json` | token, port, city |
| copies the hook | `~/.wisp/hook.sh` | so you can delete the clone afterwards |
| flashing tools | `~/.wisp/tools/` | only if you flash the board |
| runs a local server | `127.0.0.1:4666` | the board fetches state from here |

The hooks are appended to yours, never written over them, and the file is
copied first. `bridge/install_hook.py --dry-run` shows what would change;
`--remove` undoes it.

**Nothing leaves your machine.** There is no telemetry and no server of ours.
The only outbound connections are the weather forecast (Open-Meteo, no signup)
and, once at install time, discovering your city from your IP.

### About the network

The bridge listens on the local network because the board has to reach it.
That is why it demands a **token** from anything coming from outside —
generated on its own at install time and written to the board along with the
WiFi. Without it, anyone on the same network could read your project names and
your usage.

If you have a board flashed before this existed, `require_token: false` in the
config keeps it working, and the app shows a yellow warning until you reflash.

## Subscription limits

The app fetches the percentages **straight from Anthropic**, on the same
endpoint Claude Code uses (`GET /api/oauth/usage`), every 5 minutes. They are
the same numbers you see in Claude Code's usage panel, without depending on
you opening it.

For that it needs the Claude Code credential, which lives in the macOS
keychain. **macOS is the one who decides**: the first time, a dialog appears
asking for your authorization. The token never leaves your machine — it goes
in a header to `api.anthropic.com` and nowhere else, and the bridge never even
sees it.

If you decline, nothing breaks: the option turns itself off (we do not nag),
and the app falls back to the cache Claude Code keeps in `~/.claude.json`.
That cache has a 5-minute deadline, but **it is only rewritten when something
triggers a fetch** — on a test machine it sat unchanged for three days because
nobody opened the usage panel. When the cache is the source, the app shows its
age next to the number and dims it, instead of presenting stale data as if it
were current.

You can turn the fetching off at any time under **Fetch real limits** in the
panel.

### Usage computed locally

Independently of all that, the app computes usage from your transcripts over
the same windows (5h and 7 days) and compares it against your own peak of the
last 30 days. That number depends on no credential, no network and no cache:
it is always current. It answers "is today outside my normal?", which is a
different question — and sometimes a more useful one — than "how far am I from
the ceiling?".

## Next steps

Ideas worth doing, roughly in the order they earn their keep. Nothing here is
promised.

**Support agents other than Claude Code.** The architecture already allows it:
`hook.sh` only POSTs the event to `127.0.0.1:4666/hook`, and the whole state
machine lives in the bridge. Adding an agent means mapping its events onto the
seven states.

- [ ] **Codex CLI** — nearly a drop-in. Its hooks ship the same vocabulary we
      already use (`SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`,
      `PostToolUse`, `PermissionRequest`, `Stop`), configured in
      `~/.codex/hooks.json` or in `config.toml` under
      `[features] codex_hooks = true`. The work is a second installer and a
      payload adapter — the field names differ from Claude Code's.
- [ ] **Cursor** — feasible with a translation layer. The vocabulary is
      different (`beforeShellExecution`, `beforeMCPExecution`,
      `beforeReadFile`, `afterFileEdit`, `stop`), so *tool*, *working* and
      *done* map cleanly, *waiting for permission* comes out of
      `beforeShellExecution`, and there is no session-start event — the
      session would have to be born on the first event it sees. Hooks are
      configured per project in `.cursor/hooks.json`.
- [ ] **Gemini CLI and others** — not investigated yet.
- [ ] One mascot per agent, so a screen with mixed sessions still tells you
      *which* tool is doing what.

**Making the board easier still.**

- [ ] Flash from the browser with [ESP Web Tools](https://esphome.github.io/esp-web-tools/)
      — WebSerial in Chrome/Edge, no terminal at all.
- [ ] Over-the-air updates, so new firmware does not mean plugging in a cable.
- [ ] A first-boot SoftAP portal as a fallback for WiFi provisioning.

**Elsewhere.**

- [ ] Usage and limits are Anthropic-specific today; they need a shape that
      survives more than one provider.
- [ ] Linux support for the bridge (the board side is already portable; the
      port is just `/dev/ttyACM0`).
- [ ] A ready-made mascot pack, so the vector character is a choice and not
      the only option. See [MASCOTS.md](MASCOTS.md).

## Uninstall

```bash
/usr/bin/python3 bridge/install_hook.py --remove   # removes the hooks
rm -rf ~/Applications/Wisp.app ~/.wisp
```

Everything Wisp creates lives under those two paths. `--remove` also clears
entries from an older install that pointed at the clone, and keeps a backup
first.
