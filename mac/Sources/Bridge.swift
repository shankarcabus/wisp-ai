/// 1. It runs with /usr/bin/python3, the Python 3.9 that ships with macOS —
///    never the one from asdf. The bridge was written with the standard
///    library only and got `from __future__ import annotations` precisely so
///    it fits in 3.9. That way the app does not break the day you switch
///    versions.
///
/// 2. If a bridge is already up on the port, the app ADOPTS it instead of
///    trying to start another and failing with "address in use". Whoever
///    starts one from a terminal while developing keeps working with the app
///    open.
