/// Fetches the real subscription limits, straight from Anthropic.
///
/// WHY THIS EXISTS
/// ---------------
/// Claude Code keeps the percentages in a cache in ~/.claude.json with a
/// 5-minute deadline. Except the cache does not refresh itself: it is
/// rewritten when an API response carries the limit headers. If you go days
/// without opening the usage panel, the number on disk sits still — measured,
/// three days.
///
/// Here we make the same call Claude Code makes. The endpoint came from
/// reading its own binary:
///
///     fetchUtilization: GET /api/oauth/usage
///
/// ABOUT THE CREDENTIAL
/// --------------------
/// The access token belongs to Claude Code and lives in the macOS keychain.
/// This app asks the system, and it is **macOS** that decides — showing a
/// dialog for you to authorize the first time. Without your explicit
/// authorization there is no read: the app falls back to the on-disk cache and
/// reports its age.
///
/// The token never leaves your machine. It goes in a header to
/// api.anthropic.com and nowhere else. The bridge never even sees it — what
/// travels to it is only the result, over 127.0.0.1.
