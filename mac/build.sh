# by hand.
#
# Why no project: an .xcodeproj is a huge generated file, hard to review, that
# nobody edits by hand. Here the entire build fits on one screen and you can
# read what it does.
#
# The Python bridge goes INSIDE the bundle. That makes the app self-contained:
# it can go to /Applications without dragging the repository along.
#
# Usage:  ./mac/build.sh [--run]

# Ad-hoc signature: without it macOS treats the app as damaged after the first
# copy. It does not replace a developer signature, but it is enough to run on
# your own machine.
# An ad-hoc signature derives from the CONTENT of the binary: it changes on
# every rebuild, and since macOS ties keychain permission to the signature,
# each build becomes "a different app" and the previous "Always Allow" stops
# counting. With your own identity the signature derives from the CERTIFICATE
# and stays stable across builds. Create yours with ./mac/create-identity.sh —
# it is local and free.
